# RuffRuff Quick Start Guide

Get started with the RuffRuff iOS app in 5 minutes!

## Prerequisites

- macOS computer with Xcode 15.0 or later
- iOS device or simulator running iOS 16.0+
- Ruff installed (optional for initial build, required for linting)

## Step 1: Install Ruff (Optional)

If you want the linting to work, install Ruff first:

```bash
# Using pip
pip install ruff

# Or using Homebrew
brew install ruff

# Verify installation
ruff --version
```

> **Note**: You can build and run the app without Ruff installed, but linting operations will fail. The app will still open files and display syntax-highlighted code.

## Step 2: Open the Project

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd /path/to/ruffruff

# Open in Xcode
open App/RuffRuff.xcodeproj
```

Alternatively, double-click `App/RuffRuff.xcodeproj` in Finder.

## Step 3: Select a Target Device

In Xcode:
1. Look at the device selector at the top (next to the Run button)
2. Click it and choose:
   - An iOS Simulator (e.g., "iPhone 15")
   - Or your connected iOS device

## Step 4: Build and Run

Click the **Run** button (‚ñ∂Ô∏è) or press **‚åòR**

The app will:
1. Compile (takes 10-30 seconds first time)
2. Launch in the simulator or on your device
3. Show the empty state screen

## Step 5: Open Your First File

1. Tap the **folder icon** (üìÅ) in the top right
2. Navigate to a Python file on your device
3. Or use the included `sample.py` file
4. Tap to open it

The app will:
- Display the file with syntax highlighting
- Automatically run Ruff linting
- Show any warnings or errors

## Example: Using the Sample File

The repository includes a `sample.py` file with intentional issues for testing.

### On Simulator

1. The sample file is in the project folder on your Mac
2. Drag `sample.py` to the simulator window
3. It appears in the Files app
4. Open RuffRuff and navigate to Files ‚Üí On My iPhone
5. Select `sample.py`

### On Device

1. Use AirDrop to send `sample.py` to your device
2. Save to Files app
3. Open RuffRuff and browse to the file

### Expected Results

You should see:
- **2 warnings** (‚ö†Ô∏è) for long lines
- **1 error** (üî¥) for an unused variable
- Syntax highlighting with purple keywords and green strings

## Step 6: Explore Settings

1. Tap the **Settings** tab (‚öôÔ∏è) at the bottom
2. Try adjusting the line length:
   - Tap **[+]** to increase to 120
3. Return to **Editor** tab
4. Tap the **play button** (‚ñ∂Ô∏è) to re-lint
5. Notice the long-line warnings disappear!

## Common First-Time Issues

### "Code signing failed"

**Solution:**
1. Select the RuffRuff project in Xcode navigator
2. Select the RuffRuff target
3. Go to "Signing & Capabilities" tab
4. Check "Automatically manage signing"
5. Select your Team (add Apple ID in Xcode preferences if needed)

### "No provisioning profiles found"

**Solution:**
- Use a simulator instead of a device for testing
- Or create a free Apple Developer account
- Add your Apple ID in Xcode ‚Üí Preferences ‚Üí Accounts

### "Unable to open file"

**Cause:** File access permissions

**Solution:**
- Make sure you're selecting files from accessible locations
- On simulator, use the Files app or drag-and-drop
- On device, ensure files are in iCloud Drive or On My iPhone

### "Ruff command not found"

**Cause:** Ruff not installed or not in PATH

**Solutions:**
1. Install Ruff: `pip install ruff` or `brew install ruff`
2. Verify: `which ruff` shows the path
3. If needed, edit `RuffService.swift` to use absolute path:
   ```swift
   process.executableURL = URL(fileURLWithPath: "/usr/local/bin/ruff")
   ```

### App crashes when opening file

**Debug:**
1. Check Xcode console for error messages
2. Verify file is valid UTF-8 encoded text
3. Try with the included `sample.py` first

## Understanding the Results

### Diagnostic Indicators

- **üî¥ Red Circle**: Error that must be fixed
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Orange Triangle**: Warning that should be reviewed
- **Numbers in header**: Count of each type

### Rule Codes

Common codes you'll see:

- **E501**: Line too long
- **F841**: Unused variable
- **F401**: Imported but unused
- **E302**: Expected 2 blank lines
- **W292**: No newline at end of file

Tap any diagnostic icon to see the full message!

## Customizing Linting Rules

### Enable More Rules

1. Go to **Settings** tab
2. Tap **Selected Rules**
3. Tap any rule to enable it (shows ‚úì)
4. Popular additions:
   - **I** (isort) - Import sorting
   - **N** (pep8-naming) - Naming conventions
   - **D** (pydocstyle) - Docstring checks

### Ignore Specific Rules

1. Go to **Settings** tab
2. Tap **Ignored Rules**
3. Enter rule code (e.g., E501)
4. Tap [‚äï] to add

## Tips & Tricks

### Quick Re-lint
- Tap the **play button** (‚ñ∂Ô∏è) after making changes in another app
- Or after changing settings

### Understanding Line Length
- Default is 88 (Black's standard)
- PEP 8 recommends 79
- Many projects use 100 or 120
- Adjust in Settings to match your project

### Viewing Long Lines
- Scroll horizontally to see full line
- Line wrapping may be added in future version

### Multiple Files
- Close current file with **√ó** button
- Open new file with **üìÅ** button
- Current version handles one file at a time
